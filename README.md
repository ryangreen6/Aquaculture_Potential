# Exploring Aquaculture Potential on the West Coast of North America

Marine aquaculture has the potential to significantly contribute to the global food supply, offering a more sustainable protein source compared to conventional land-based meat production. 

The purpose of this repository is to determine which Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) on the West Coast of the US are most suitable for marine aquaculture. The majority of the code examines the EEZ suitability for Oysters and Pacific Herring. Additionally, a function called `aquaculture` was created to apply the same steps to any marine species desired. Suitable locations are determined by bathymetry and by average sea surface temperatures.
